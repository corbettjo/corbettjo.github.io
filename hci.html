            <h3>MyNeu</h3>
            <img class="codeImage " src="Images/HCI/MyNeu.JPG">
            <p>The idea behind the myNeu redo is to create a streamlined system that is adaptable and useful. The current myNeu is a bit disorganized, and has an outdated user experience. The new system would have a dedicated section for relevant notifications, alerting the user to things such as new email or payments due. The main section of the interface would give broad, expandable cards, each labeled with topics relevant to the user (housing, registration, finance, etc.) The use could expand the card they desired and access links from the submenu. I think this small amount of organization would greatly increase workflow and usability.
            </p>


            <h3>MyFood</h3>
            <img class="codeImage " src="Images/HCI/MyFood.JPG">
            <p>The concept of myFood is an application contains all relevant information about dining on campus. The landing page would contain a list of all dining facilities at Northeastern (that are open that day), the time they close, and a quick glance at the menu. The data would be updated to highlight the new or rotating menu items, and from the landing page the user could tap a card for the full menu of a dining facility. Each menu item would be a searchable term, and the user could see where their favorite food was being served that day, or the next time it would be on campus. There is also the possibility for sharing integration, where the user could share the menu of the day with friends via text, or another form of social media.
            </p>


            <h3>MyCampus</h3>
            <img class="codeImage " src="Images/HCI/MyCampus.JPG">
            <p>MyCampus follows the same thought process of MyFood. With the size of Northeastern, it’s tough to track everything that is happening on any given day. MyCampus is the social solution. It acts as a calendar, showing what events are happening today, this week, and this month on campus. Each event is categorized by type, and the user can pin their favorite types of events to their home screen to receive information about them first. One possible way to populate the data would be to work with Facebooks calendar system, and pull data from selected user’s event schedule (like the Nor’easters, NU Hockey, etc.) There could also be a social aspect like MyFood, where users could share events via third party apps.
